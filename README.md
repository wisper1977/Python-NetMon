## Version History

### v1.2 - Performance Enhancing
**Release Date:** TBD
- Fixed issues with the database locking
- Fixed issues with a delay to acknowledging devices

### v1.2 - SNMP, SQLLite, Plugins
**Release Date:** 9/2/2024

**Core Enhancements**

*SNMP Integration:*
- Implemented SNMP monitoring using the NetOpsSNMP class.
- Added SNMP status checks to determine device reachability, with fallback to ping if SNMP fails.
- Configurable SNMP community strings via config.ini.

*SQLite Integration:*
- Integrated SQLite database for storing device information, logs, and status updates.
- Introduced SystemLog class to manage program logs, including error handling and informational messages.
- Environment setup now ensures database and required folders are created if they do not exist.

**Plugins Architecture**

*Plugin System:*
-Introduced a plugins folder for modular functionality.
-Dynamic Tools menu loads and executes plugins at runtime.

*Syslog Plugin:*
- Developed a Syslog server plugin that listens for syslog messages and stores them in SQLite.
- Integrated Syslog Viewer in the Tools menu to display and filter syslog messages.
  
*Speed Test Plugin:*
- Added a speed test plugin utilizing speedtest-cli.
- GUI for running speed tests and displaying download, upload speeds, and ping.
- Thread-safe GUI updates within the plugin.

**Performance and Stability Improvements**

*Thread-Safe Queue Management:*
- Implemented a thread-safe queue (update_queue) for managing GUI updates from background threads.
- Ensured all GUI interactions from background threads are routed through this queue.

*Device Status Tracking:*
- Introduced counters for tracking consecutive successes and failures for device checks to prevent intermittent "flashing" statuses.
- Threshold-based mechanism for determining device reachability based on multiple checks.

*Error Handling and Logging:*
- Improved error handling across modules, with comprehensive logging for easier troubleshooting.
- Enhanced System Log viewer with log level filters and search functionality.

**User Interface and Usability**

*Reduced Application Size:*

- Optimized the codebase, reducing the overall size by approximately 50%.
- Simplified GUI code while adding new features, ensuring a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.

*Improved Device Management:*
- Streamlined device management dialogs (add, edit, delete) for easier interaction.
- Correctly tracks and highlights acknowledged devices in the Treeview.

*Enhanced Visual Feedback:*
- Improved visual indicators in the Treeview for device statuses, with color-coding for reachable and unreachable devices.
- Added a countdown timer and progress bar for refresh intervals, giving users clear feedback on the next check.

**Environment Setup**

*Automated Setup:*
- Automated environment setup ensures all necessary Python packages are installed.
- Added firewall configuration steps for both Windows and Linux to allow Syslog traffic on UDP port 514.

## Known Bugs
- Performance issue, program locking up.
  
## Future Plans
- Detailed Device Views: Implement functionality for users to click on a device in the list and display detailed information or statistics in a separate dialog or pane.
- Input Validation: Implement rigorous input validation to secure against potential injection attacks, particularly for inputs affecting network operations or subprocess invocations.
- Penetration Testing: Conduct penetration testing to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities.
